This is Jesumbo's portfolio built on a template from HTML5up, it is a text-heavy, project-oriented design built around a huge background
image and scroll effects (powered by Scrollex). A presentation of Data analysis projects using tools such as Microsoft Excel, SQL, Tableau, 
Power BI, Python, R, and so on. Enjoy it :)

Template courtesy of HTML5up, a radtastic collection of website templates you can use for pretty much whatever.
